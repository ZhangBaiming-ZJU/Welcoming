# 🚀 Welcome to Baiming Zhang's GitHub Desktop!

## 🏫 Zhejiang University

I'm a 🎓 junior undergraduate majoring in Engineering Mechanics at School of Aeronautics and Astronautics 🚀 (Chu Kochen Honors College) with a grade of 3.93/4.0 up to June 29, 2025.

I'm now doing research in 🔬 Quantum Computational Fluid Dynamics.

## 📚 Academic and Research Experience

### ⚛️ Quantum States and Devices Research

- 🌟 **October 2023 - June 2024:** 
  Under the guidance of Professor Dawei Wang, Dr. Xingqi Xu and Dr. Jiefei Wang, I engaged in research within the field of quantum optics, focusing on Rydberg atoms and topological insulators.

- 🧲 **June 2024 - December 2024:** 
  I explored magnetic field precision measurement and attempted a transition into the study of Fock states and quantum Hall effect.

### 🌊 Fluid Mechanics and Quantum Computing
- 📚 **January 2025 - April 2025:** 
  Under the mentorship of Professor Shiying Xiong, I shifted my focus to fluid dynamics and quantum computing within my major. I also contributed to a portion of the book writing related to my advisor's research.

### 🧠 Machine learning and Quantum Hamilton Neural Networks (QHNN)
- 🤖 **April 2025 - June 2025:** 
  I delved into the study of neural networks, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and Hamilton Neural Networks (HNN), as well as smaller networks like Taylor-Net.

- 💡 **June 2025 - Present:** 
  Leveraging my early knowledge in quantum computing and current expertise in neural networks, I have been working on Quantum Hamilton Neural Networks (QHNN).
